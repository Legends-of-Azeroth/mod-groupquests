# Group Quests
This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

# Features
This module is used to make quest items drop for all members of a group. In some cases it also help other objectives count for all members of a group. It adds items that you normally loot from the ground to the loot tables of nearby creatures to make it easier for groups to complete those quests.
